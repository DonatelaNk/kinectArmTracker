------ OSC FORMAT

The format for the osc data is the following.
osc address: "armTracker" 
arg 0: shoulder angle - float - degrees
arg 1: elbow angle - float - degrees
arg 2: wrist angle - float - degrees
arg 3: thumb angle - float - degrees


------ OSC IP AND PORT

By default the app binds to port 9555 of the broadcast address. So packets are sent to all computers on the network. 
If you don't have a router it should default to 127.0.0.1 
If you want to override the ip address and set a specific one edit the file "data/oscIP.xml"
NOTE: the receive test app is hardcoded to port 9555.
